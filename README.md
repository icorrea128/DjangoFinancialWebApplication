# DjangoFinancialWebApplication

This project is still in the making but the template for the front end is what the end product will look like. There are 9 graphs to analyze the ticker examined and inputs that will allow the graphs to update automatically given the correct real time data API. 

To start go to the financialapplication folder in the terminal and run "python manage.py runserver"

This should get the server going. Open the link and examine. 

There are javascript files found in the static folder under assets. The index.html is in the templates. 

If react is DOM friendly let's move this idea to react.js if not then we can move it to a regular HTML, CSS, Javascript type project.

Objective: 

If react is DOM friendly then move this project to react.js
